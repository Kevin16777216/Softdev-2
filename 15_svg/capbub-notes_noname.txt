Capture Bubble Toil Trouble

Predictions:
1:
  When a table element is clicked, there will be an alert saying the html inside
  the <td> tag
2:
  Same as 1, but now if any part of the table is clicked, the innerHTML will be
  alerted by the order of how specific the element clicked was. For example, If
  it was a cell, then the cell contents will be alerted, then HTML code with the
  table row, then the HTML code within the entire table. If just the border of
  the table is clicked, only the HTML code within the <table> tag is alerted.
3:
  If e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, then only the HTML code within the
  <table> tag is alerted. The event does not trigger other event listeners.
  The order usually is from most specific to least specific, but now it seems
  that adding true as an option makes everything below that level not alert.
4:
  If e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, same result as 3. Order of the
  listeners added doesn't seem to matter.
